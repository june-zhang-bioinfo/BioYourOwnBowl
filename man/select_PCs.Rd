\name{select_PCs}
\alias{select_PCs}
\title{Select principal components based on variance explained}
\usage{
select_PCs(object, improved_diff_quantile = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object.}

\item{improved_diff_quantile}{Quantile threshold for changes in variance
explained. Lower values select more PCs. Default is 0.6.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of selected PC indices
}
\description{
This function analyzes the variance explained by each principal component
and selects the optimal number of PCs based on changes in variance explained.
It also generates an elbow plot with a red line indicating the selected PCs.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
selected_pcs <- select_PCs(seurat_obj, improved_diff_quantile = 0.6)
}
