\title{Plot mean-variance relationship with feature highlighting}
\usage{
plot_mean_variance(object, features = NULL, file_name = "Mean-variance")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object.}

\item{features}{Character vector of selected feature names to
highlight. If NULL, only the variable features plot is generated.
Default is NULL}

\item{file_name}{Character string file_name for output PNG filenames.
Default is "Mean-variance"}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data frame with gene statistics (mean, variance,
log-transformed values)
}
\description{
Generates mean-variance plots highlighting different sets of features:
variable features, selected features, and their overlap. Creates multiple
PNG files with the specified prefix.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Plot only variable features
plot_mean_variance(seurat_obj)

# Plot with selected features
selected_genes <- c("Gene1", "Gene2", "Gene3")
gene_stats <- plot_mean_variance(seurat_obj, selected_genes, file_name = "my_analysis")
}
}
